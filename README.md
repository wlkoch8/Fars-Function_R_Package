# FARS-Function_R_Package

This repository contains code for building a software package in R forthe Building R Packages class (Course #3) in the Mastering Software Development in R Specialization by Coursera (Roger Peng, Brooke Anderson) 

This package contains functions that read and manipulate data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which contains nationwide data on motor vehicle traffic crashes and fatal injuries.

The package contains user-accesible functions which:

* Read in a FARS file
* Return a subset of data for a range of years
* Create a summary of data from a range of years
* Map vehicle crash data for a specified state and year
